##FeroToken🔍
I am creating a Token exchange platform similar to some exchange platforms such as: "Bitfinex", which interacts with a smart contract distributed on Ganache and built, compiled with Remix Ide.
I created my ERC20 token called FeroToken using the OpenZeppelin standard, to create a spendable coin in which users can buy or sell within my platform.
When a user registers, first of all he must register with one of the addresses that Ganche offers, then a contract function is automatically called and the new user will receive an amount between 1 and 10 tokens and even an amount between 1500 and 2000 dollars.
The database used is MongoDB which will save the addresses and tokens and the various orders that will be made.
**IMPORTANT**
 the first Ganache account is used as a faucet
so users need to start signing up from the second account
